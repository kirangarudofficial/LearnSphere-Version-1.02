## 🚀 Building Enterprise-Scale EdTech: A 47-Microservice Learning Management System

I'm excited to share the architecture of **Learning Hub** - a next-generation Learning Management System built with modern cloud-native technologies!

### 📊 **Project Scale:**
✅ **47 Microservices** running on Amazon EKS  
✅ **7 Kubernetes Namespaces** for logical separation  
✅ **Multi-AZ deployment** for 99.9% uptime  
✅ **Event-driven architecture** with Apache Kafka  
✅ **150+ API endpoints** serving diverse functionality  

### 🏗️ **Architecture Highlights:**

**🎓 Learning Core (11 services):**  
Course management, assessments, assignments, certificates, progress tracking, calendar, and code execution for interactive learning

**📹 Media Processing (5 services):**  
HLS video streaming, live classes, video transcoding, and document management

**💬 Engagement (10 services):**  
Real-time chat, discussion forums, notifications, email, gamification, support tickets, and content moderation

**💰 Commerce (6 services):**  
Payment processing, billing, shopping cart, coupons, subscriptions, and affiliate management

**📊 Analytics & AI (6 services):**  
Advanced analytics, reporting, full-text search, AI-powered recommendations, and data export

**⚙️ Platform (9 services):**  
Admin dashboard, webhooks, audit logs, feature flags, multi-language support, and integrations

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**

**Backend:** NestJS + TypeScript + Prisma ORM  
**Infrastructure:** AWS EKS, RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, MSK (Kafka), OpenSearch  
**Storage:** Amazon S3 + CloudFront CDN  
**Security:** AWS WAF, IAM, Secrets Manager, KMS  
**Monitoring:** CloudWatch, X-Ray  
**CI/CD:** Jenkins with shared library  
**Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes  

### 🎯 **Key Features:**

🔹 Multi-tenant organization support  
🔹 Real-time video streaming with adaptive bitrate  
🔹 Live class support (RTMP/WebRTC)  
🔹 AI-powered course recommendations  
🔹 Comprehensive analytics dashboard  
🔹 Automated grading & feedback  
🔹 Certificate generation  
🔹 Social learning (chat, forums)  
🔹 Gamification (badges, leaderboards)  
🔹 Multiple payment gateways  

### 📈 **Performance Metrics:**

⚡ Sub-100ms API response time  
🌍 Global CDN distribution  
🔄 Auto-scaling from 2-10 replicas per service  
💾 Multi-AZ database replication  
🔒 End-to-end encryption  
📊 Real-time event streaming  

### 💡 **Key Learnings:**

1. **Microservices at Scale:** Managing inter-service communication with Kafka event streaming
2. **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Namespace-based isolation and resource optimization
3. **AWS Best Practices:** Multi-AZ deployment, security groups, and cost optimization
4. **Real-time Features:** WebSocket implementation for chat and live streaming
5. **Database Strategy:** Hybrid approach (PostgreSQL + Redis + OpenSearch)

### 🎓 **Impact:**

This architecture is designed to support:
- **Millions of concurrent users**
- **Thousands of courses**
- **Real-time collaboration**
- **Global content delivery**
- **Enterprise-grade security**
